 BACKGROUND :

 Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
 By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available
through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company
has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital
marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and
consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google
Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

OUR OBJECTIVE (Business Task) :

Urška Sršen, Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer ask for this questions :

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

We will answer by analyzing some non-BellaBeat consumer data (FitBit Fitness Tracker App, a competitor) to gain insights and reveal some opportunities for the Bellabeat marketing team.
